// JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, 
you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.

This is it — time to put your new JavaScript skills to work. 
These projects are similar to the algorithm scripting challenges you've done before – just much more difficult.

Complete these 5 JavaScript projects to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.


// Project:
// Palindrome Checker

Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.
